🎯My short-term goal with respect to my tech career is to become an AWS Community Builder.

📌Apart from my technical expertise, I love reading books and writing. So, I have aligned both with my long-term goal of becoming a writer. I write self-improvement blogs, sharing knowledge I have gained from books. Additionally, I enjoy learning about financial management, so I read finance-related books as well. Currently, I'm authoring the book "The Guest We Are."
